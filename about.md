The Science and Engineering Applications Grid (SEAGrid) is a tool that allows researchers to easily use scientific applications deployed across a wide range of supercomputers, campus clusters, and computing cloud. SEAGrid features both a powerful desktop client and go-anywhere Web application. SEAGrid helps scientist create model inputs, simplifies access to computing resources, enables visualizations of outputs, and provides archives for simulation data.

## Features

- SEAGrid enables **Computational Chemistry:** Optimize and characterize molecular and periodic structures and predict thermodynamics and kinetics using computational chemistry applications using Ab initio, Semi-empirical, Force-field based codes such as Gaussian, Gamess, Tinker, DFTB+. 
- SEAGrid enables **Molecular Dynamics (MD):** Time evolution of large material and biological systems to predict dynamic structural and energetic characteristics  using Applications such as Lammps, Amber, NAMD using mostly empirical force fields including reaction force fields.
- SEAGrid enables **Structural Mechanics:** Finite element analysis of engineering structures and components for modeling  static and low-speed dynamic events both in the time and frequency domain using applications such as Abaqus.
- SEAGrid enables **Fluid Dynamics:** Modeling gases and liquids under steady or unsteady incompressible fluid flow with thermal and passive scalar transport governed by Navier-Stokes equations Currently the virtual organization serves more than 600 users under 320 projects. using applications such as Nek5000 and OpenFOAM.

## Leadership
The SEAGrid science gateway is led by Dr. Sudhakar Pamidighantam and powered by the NSF-funded SciGaP project. This gateway is an agile platform suitable for both research and teaching in science and engineering disciplines. 

## History

SEAGrid has evolved from GridChem which has been serving the computational chemistry community over a decade.
